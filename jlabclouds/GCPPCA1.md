Professional Cloud Architect
Certification exam guide
A Google Cloud Certied Professional Cloud Architect enables organizations to leverage
Google Cloud technologies. Through an understanding of cloud architecture and Google
technology, this individual designs, develops, and manages robust, secure, scalable, highly
available, and dynamic solutions to drive business objectives. The Cloud Architect should be
procient in all aspects of enterprise cloud strategy, solution design, and architectural best
practices. The Cloud Architect should also be experienced in soware development
methodologies and approaches including multi-tiered distributed applications which span
multicloud or hybrid environments.
Case studies
During the exam for the Cloud Architect Certication, some of the questions may refer you to
a case study that describes a ctitious business and solution concept. These case studies are
intended to provide additional context to help you choose your answers. Review the case
studies that may be used in the exam.

● Security controls (e.g., auditing, VPC Service Controls, context aware access,
organization policy)
3
● Managing customer-managed encryption keys with Cloud Key Management Service
● Remote access
3.2 Designing for compliance. Considerations include:
● Legislation (e.g., health record privacy, children’s privacy, data privacy, and ownership)
● Commercial (e.g., sensitive data such as credit card information handling, personally
identiable information [PII])
● Industry certications (e.g., SOC 2)
● Audits (including logs)
Section 4: Analyzing and optimizing technical and business processes (~18% of
the exam)
